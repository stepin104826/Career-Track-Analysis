# Career Track Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes student engagement with career tracks on the 365 online learning platformby retrieving data from an SQL database and visualized the results in Tableau. It focuses on enrollments and completions to provide insights for improving course offerings and student support.

## Objective
To analyze and visualize data on career track enrollments and completions, aiming to enhance educational services.

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL: Data extraction and manipulation
- Tableau: Data visualization

## Key Findings
1. Month with most enrollments: August (1653)
2. Most popular career track: Data Analyst (5130 enrollments)
3. High enrollment months: January, April, May, and August
4. Completion times vary by track:
   - Business Analyst: 104.77 days
   - Data Analyst: 133.80 days
   - Data Scientist: 150.14 days

## Recommendations

- Consider tailoring support based on track difficulty and typical completion times

## Visualizations
The project includes several Tableau visualizations:
1. Duration for Track Completion
2. Number of Enrollments and Fraction of Completion
3. Career Track's Strength
4. Average Completion Days
5. Completion Rate by Month

## Future Work
- Analyze factors influencing completion rates
- Investigate correlations between enrollment patterns and external factors
- Develop predictive models for student success
